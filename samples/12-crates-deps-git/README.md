# Hands-on Lab

## Introduction

This is a Rust hands-on lab for beginners. You can find the sample solution in this folder. However, if you want to practice, try to implement the program on your own and only look at the solution if you are stuck.

You will practice in this lab:

* Working with *Git dependencies*

Note that this lab builds on [the previous one](https://github.com/rstropek/CargoIntro/tree/master/samples/11-crates-folder). It assumes that are familiar with it and its learning goals.

## The Requirements

* **Move** the library from the [previous exercise](https://github.com/rstropek/CargoIntro/tree/master/samples/11-crates-folder) in a separate GitHub repository. Make sure that the separate library can be properly compiled and tested.

* Change the *folder reference* to a *Git reference*.

## Sample Output

The output of your new application should not changed compared to [the original version](https://github.com/rstropek/CargoIntro/tree/master/samples/10-crates-deps).
